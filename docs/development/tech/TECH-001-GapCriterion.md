TECH-001 — Introduce GapCriterion

Priority: Low
Status: Backlog

Description:
Create a new abstract GapCriterion base class when at least two
criteria share the same absolute-gap scoring algorithm.

Potential users:
- YearCriterion
- NumberOfOwnersCriterion
- Crit'AirCriterion (if implemented)
- Future criteria based on absolute difference

Rationale:
Avoid premature abstraction while keeping the architecture open for
future extensions.
